Command-line apps to automate some common Twitter activities

These tools are made to increase customer engagement and awareness on Twitter.

The "brand likebot" is designed to like tweets that were also liked by brands that the account sells. 

The "hashtag likebot" is designed to like tweets from relevant hashtags, but can be modified to like tweets based on selective queries too.

The "direct message bot" is designed to search for accounts that are followers, follow them back, and then immediately send a welcome message via direct message. This can be bypassed by muting a follower beforehand.
